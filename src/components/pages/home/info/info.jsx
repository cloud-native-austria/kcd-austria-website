      <strong>Kubernetes Community Days</strong> (KCDs) are global, community-organized events that
      gather adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities, supported by
      the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
      <br />
      <br />
      This is our second edition in <strong>Vienna</strong>, and weâ€™re thrilled to unite the
      community once again. Our goal is to offer a platform for professionals and experts of all
      experiences and backgrounds to explore, connect, and exchange their insights on everything
      related to Cloud Native.
